# zh - Zsh History Search

A fuzzy search tool for your zsh/bash command history using fzf.

## Features

- 🔍 **Fuzzy search** through your entire command history
- 🖥️ **Cross-shell support** - works with both zsh and bash


## Requirements

- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - Install with `brew install fzf` (macOS) or `apt install fzf` (Ubuntu)

## Installation

### Manual Installation

1. **Download the script:**
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/zsh-history/main/zh
   ```

2. **Make it executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x zh
   ```

3. **Move to your PATH as `zh`:**
   ```bash
   sudo mv zh /usr/local/bin/zh
   ```

4. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   zh
   ```

## Usage

Simply type `zh` in your terminal to open the fuzzy search interface:

```bash
zh
```

- **Search**: Type to filter commands
- **Navigate**: Use arrow keys or Ctrl+J/K
- **Select**: Press Enter to execute the selected command
- **Exit**: Press Esc or Ctrl+C

## How it works

1. Reads your zsh history file (`~/.zhistory`) or bash history (`~/.bash_history`)
2. Removes timestamp prefixes and duplicates (keeping newest)
3. Opens fzf with newest commands first
4. Executes your selected command
